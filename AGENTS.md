# Reveille repository conventions

- Run `just check` before pushing. It is the repository gate, and CI runs exactly the `ci-*`
  recipes it depends on — one per CI job, and nothing else. **Add a check to a `ci-*` recipe in
  the justfile, never as a step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**; `tools/check-sources.mjs` rejects
  a workflow step that is not `just ci-…` and requires the two lists to match.
- The toolchains are pinned in the tree, not in CI: `rust-toolchain.toml` names the compiler (and
  `Cargo.toml`'s `rust-version` must equal it) and `.node-version` names Node. No workflow names a
  version of its own.
- Use default `cargo fmt` formatting. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  must pass.
- Model library errors with `thiserror`. Do not use `unwrap` or `expect` outside tests and the
  executable `main` boundary.
- Keep `reveille-core` policy-free: no terminal output, process spawning, or exit codes. I/O
  presentation and platform policy belong in `reveille-cli` and `reveille-app`.
- Prefer newtypes over bare primitives where mixing values would fail silently, including map
  keys, BSP checksums, client counts, and ports.
- Put a source comment beside every protocol constant (for example, `// sv_gamespy.c:42`) so
  it can be re-verified against the engine.
- Add `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only` to every new source file. The repository license
  is GPL-2.0-only.

Engine ground truth is the openmohaa source at https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa. Clone it
when a protocol or filesystem question comes up.
