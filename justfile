# Recipes are single commands that read the same under `sh` and under `cmd`, so the same justfile
# serves the Windows machine and the aarch64 Linux one. Two things forced that:
#
#   * `just` runs recipes under `sh` on every platform unless told otherwise, and Windows has no
#     `sh`. Hence `windows-shell` below.
#   * `bash` on a Windows PATH is normally the WSL shim in System32, not Git Bash — a
#     different filesystem with a different toolchain. Pointing at it would be worse than `cmd`.
#
# `cmd` rather than PowerShell because Windows PowerShell 5.1 has neither `&&` nor `||`, which
# `bundle` and `engine-source` rely on.
