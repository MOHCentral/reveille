# Reveille

Reveille is a newcomer-first launcher for Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and its two
expansions, Spearhead and Breakthrough. The Windows app launches Original, OpenMoHAA, or Reborn;
the macOS 11+ app launches native OpenMoHAA. Both identify existing player-owned game data,
browse servers answering now, check their map rotations, and safely install exact missing-map
matches. The reusable pipeline lives in `reveille-core`; both the CLI proof and Tauri desktop
shell call it directly, while `reveille-platform` holds host capabilities, write targets, process
checks, and launch policy.

Each game has its own server list and its own content directory: Allied Assault reads `main`,
Spearhead reads `main` and then `mainta`, Breakthrough reads `main` and then `maintt`. The app
offers only the ones the selected folder actually has, in the toolbar's **Game** switch.

## Run the Windows app

```console
cargo run -p reveille-app
```

That runs the development build. A packaged Windows installer is built by
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml): a `v*` tag produces an NSIS
installer and attaches it to a draft release, and a manual run leaves the same installer as a
workflow artifact. It installs for the current user, so it needs no Administrator, and it fetches
the WebView2 runtime on machines that lack it.

## Run or package the macOS app

The development command is the same on a Mac:

```console
cargo run -p reveille-app
```

`just bundle-macos` builds the universal Apple Silicon/Intel `.app` and `.dmg`, targeting macOS
11.0 and later. Setup shows OpenMoHAA only and uses the bare native `openmohaa` executable.

Every `v*` release builds the universal DMG and adds its updater archive under the
`darwin-universal` manifest target. With a Developer ID certificate and Apple notarization
credentials configured, the release workflow signs, notarizes and staples the DMG and validates
all three. Without any of them it ad-hoc signs the app, and the release notes tell Mac users to
allow it once under Privacy & Security. A partial set of Apple secrets fails the release.

For a signed build, the release job expects the base64-encoded Developer ID certificate in
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, its password in `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, a temporary-keychain password
in `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, and Apple's notarization values in `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, and
`APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

Published releases are also offered inside installed copies of Reveille. The updater uses Tauri's
mandatory release signatures, shows **Update and restart** and **Later**, and never installs from a
background check alone. Before building a release, generate the updater key once:

```console
just updater-key-generate path/to/reveille.key
```

Store the private key as the GitHub Actions secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, its password (when
set) as `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`, and the generated public key as the repository
variable `REVEILLE_UPDATER_PUBKEY`. Keep the private key outside the repository and backed up: an
installed release can accept future updates only from that key. To reproduce the signed updater
installer and signature locally, run `just bundle-updater path/to/reveille.key`; leave the signing
prompt empty for a key created without a password.

Cut a release in one step:

```console
just release 0.1.4
```

It refuses a dirty working tree or an existing tag before touching anything, updates the Cargo,
Tauri and npm release identities together, runs `just check` against the bumped tree, then commits
the five versioned files and creates an annotated `v0.1.4`. Pushing stays manual, because the tag
push is what starts the installer build; the recipe prints the two `git push` commands when it
finishes. Add `--dry-run` to stop after the checks, or `--no-check` to skip the gate.

Nothing in `website/` carries a version: the download buttons link to `releases/latest` and the page
asks the GitHub API for the installer, so a release never leaves the site advertising an older one.
There is no website step to remember.

`just bump-version 0.1.4` is the same version update on its own, without the gate, the commit or the
tag. `just release` calls it, and it owns the rules both share: it refuses an invalid or
non-increasing semantic version and stops if the existing release identities already disagree. Reach
for it directly to validate a version (`--dry-run`) or when the bump belongs in a commit of its own
making rather than in a tagged release commit.

**Windows builds are not code-signed yet.** Windows names no publisher for them and SmartScreen may hold
the download. The signing route is decided — SignPath Foundation's free certificate for open-source
projects — but the application follows the first release rather than preceding it; `docs/plan.md`
records why, and what the certificate does and does not change. winget manifests remain shipping
work outside v1.

## Prove Journey B in one command

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- journey 203.0.113.10:12203 --path "C:\Games\MOHAA" --execute
```

This detects and identifies the install, performs a complete live browse, preflights the chosen
server, resolves and installs safe exact map matches, rescans, and launches only when the final
check is Compatible. Omit `--execute` to leave the launch step as a printed command.

## Scan an install

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- scan /path/to/MOHAA
```

The scan reports the number of archives and maps, duplicate map providers, and the effective
checksum for every map. Providers are ordered in engine lookup order; the first provider is the
file the engine loads. Add `--game spearhead` or `--game breakthrough` to index that game's
search path instead, which is the expansion's directory over `main` rather than in place of it.

## Browse public servers

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- browse --path /path/to/MOHAA
```

Use `--limit N` for a smaller sample, `--game spearhead` or `--game breakthrough` for an
expansion, and `--format json` for the complete structured report and per-server compatibility
assessments. Displayed player counts come from the server's reported human connections; bots are
reported separately. A connection may still be downloading or idle.

## Prepare a join

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- join 203.0.113.10:12203 /path/to/MOHAA
```

This runs status discovery, rotation preflight, and content-source resolution, then prints a
typed launch command. It does not install content or start a process.

## Development

```console
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
```

## Telemetry

Reveille sends anonymous usage statistics and crash reports so we can see where new players get
stuck. It is on by default; turn it off under Settings, Privacy, and nothing more is sent. The CLI
never sends anything.

While it is on, Reveille sends these events to PostHog's EU region:

- the app started, and the previous run crashed (with the Reveille version and a source file and
  line, never the error text);
- a game folder was found (which games it holds), and first-time setup finished (game and engine);
- the server list loaded (how many servers) or failed (the kind of failure);
- a server was selected (once per run), and whether it was ready to join;
- a map download started, finished or failed (which kind of download, and how many maps);
- Join was pressed, the game started, or the join failed (with a short reason code such as
  `engine_missing` or `download_failed`).

Every event carries a random installation ID, a random ID for this run of the app, the Reveille
version, the operating system (`windows` or `macos`) and a timestamp. The installation ID is
created at random on first launch and deleted when you turn statistics off; it is not derived from
your hardware, account or files.

Reveille never sends player names, server names or addresses, server passwords, CD keys, your
Windows username or computer name, folder paths, error messages or your server history. IP-based
location lookup is turned off for every event, and the PostHog project discards client IP
addresses.

Every event is defined in one place, [`crates/reveille-app/src/telemetry.rs`](crates/reveille-app/src/telemetry.rs).
Builds made without the `REVEILLE_TELEMETRY_KEY` environment variable, including every local
build, never send anything.

Windows installer ships `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` beside the executable, listing every component
it links and that component's own licence.
