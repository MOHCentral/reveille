# Reveille

Reveille is a newcomer-first launcher for Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and its two
expansions, Spearhead and Breakthrough. The Windows app launches Original, OpenMoHAA, or Reborn;
the macOS 11+ app launches native OpenMoHAA. Both identify existing player-owned game data,
browse servers answering now, check their map rotations, and safely install exact missing-map
matches. The reusable pipeline lives in `reveille-core`; both the CLI proof and Tauri desktop
shell call it directly, while `reveille-platform` holds host capabilities, write targets, process
checks, and launch policy.

Each game has its own server list and its own content directory: Allied Assault reads `main`,
Spearhead reads `main` and then `mainta`, Breakthrough reads `main` and then `maintt`. The app
offers only the ones the selected folder actually has, in the toolbar's **Game** switch.

## Run the Windows app

```console
cargo run -p reveille-app
```

That runs the development build. A packaged Windows installer is built by
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml): a `v*` tag produces an NSIS
installer and attaches it to a draft release, and a manual run leaves the same installer as a
workflow artifact. It installs for the current user, so it needs no Administrator, and it fetches
the WebView2 runtime on machines that lack it.

## Run or package the macOS app

The development command is the same on a Mac:

```console
cargo run -p reveille-app
```

`just bundle-macos` builds the universal Apple Silicon/Intel `.app` and `.dmg`, targeting macOS
11.0 and later. Setup shows OpenMoHAA only and uses the bare native `openmohaa` executable. A
`macos-preview-v*` tag creates an explicitly unsigned GitHub prerelease; it does not replace the
website's normal latest release and is never offered through self-update.

Regular `v*` macOS artifacts require a Developer ID certificate and Apple notarization
credentials. The release workflow signs, notarizes and staples the universal DMG, validates all
three, and adds its signed updater archive under the `darwin-universal` manifest target. General
availability remains blocked until the physical-Mac journey in `docs/plan.md` passes.

The regular release job expects the base64-encoded Developer ID certificate in
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, its password in `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, a temporary-keychain password
in `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, and Apple's notarization values in `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, and
`APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

Published releases are also offered inside installed copies of Reveille. The updater uses Tauri's
mandatory release signatures, shows **Update and restart** and **Later**, and never installs from a
background check alone. Before building a release, generate the updater key once:

```console
just updater-key-generate path/to/reveille.key
```

Store the private key as the GitHub Actions secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, its password (when
set) as `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`, and the generated public key as the repository
variable `REVEILLE_UPDATER_PUBKEY`. Keep the private key outside the repository and backed up: an
installed release can accept future updates only from that key. To reproduce the signed updater
installer and signature locally, run `just bundle-updater path/to/reveille.key`; leave the signing
prompt empty for a key created without a password.

Cut a release in one step:

```console
just release 0.1.4
```

It refuses a dirty working tree or an existing tag before touching anything, updates the Cargo,
Tauri and npm release identities together, runs `just check` against the bumped tree, then commits
the five versioned files and creates an annotated `v0.1.4`. Pushing stays manual, because the tag
push is what starts the installer build; the recipe prints the two `git push` commands when it
finishes. Add `--dry-run` to stop after the checks, or `--no-check` to skip the gate.

Nothing in `website/` carries a version: the download buttons link to `releases/latest` and the page
asks the GitHub API for the installer, so a release never leaves the site advertising an older one.
There is no website step to remember.

`just bump-version 0.1.4` is the same version update on its own, without the gate, the commit or the
tag. `just release` calls it, and it owns the rules both share: it refuses an invalid or
non-increasing semantic version and stops if the existing release identities already disagree. Reach
for it directly to validate a version (`--dry-run`) or when the bump belongs in a commit of its own
making rather than in a tagged release commit.

**Windows builds are not code-signed yet.** Windows names no publisher for them and SmartScreen may hold
the download. The signing route is decided — SignPath Foundation's free certificate for open-source
projects — but the application follows the first release rather than preceding it; `docs/plan.md`
records why, and what the certificate does and does not change. winget manifests remain shipping
work outside v1.

## Prove Journey B in one command

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- journey 203.0.113.10:12203 --path "C:\Games\MOHAA" --execute
```

This detects and identifies the install, performs a complete live browse, preflights the chosen
server, resolves and installs safe exact map matches, rescans, and launches only when the final
check is Compatible. Omit `--execute` to leave the launch step as a printed command.

## Scan an install

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- scan /path/to/MOHAA
```

The scan reports the number of archives and maps, duplicate map providers, and the effective
checksum for every map. Providers are ordered in engine lookup order; the first provider is the
file the engine loads. Add `--game spearhead` or `--game breakthrough` to index that game's
search path instead, which is the expansion's directory over `main` rather than in place of it.

## Browse public servers

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- browse --path /path/to/MOHAA
```

Use `--limit N` for a smaller sample, `--game spearhead` or `--game breakthrough` for an
expansion, and `--format json` for the complete structured report and per-server compatibility
assessments. Displayed client counts are the server's non-free slots; Reveille never labels them
players or humans.

## Prepare a join

```console
cargo run -p reveille-cli -- join 203.0.113.10:12203 /path/to/MOHAA
```

This runs status discovery, rotation preflight, and content-source resolution, then prints a
typed launch command. It does not install content or start a process.

## Development

```console
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
```
