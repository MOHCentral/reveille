// the decision is made. The list deliberately does not repeat them as badges.
// Each name states what Reveille measured rather than how confident it feels
// about it (lib/format.js `stateName`, docs/ux-standards.md §1.1).
//
// The fourth, Compatible, is rendered nowhere. A ready server has nothing to
// qualify, and a heading reading `Compatible` above a button reading `Join`
// restates the control beneath it. Silence is the correct rendering of "nothing
// to do" (docs/ui.md §9).
//
// The join gate is about the map running *now*, not the whole rotation. A server
// with one unobtainable map later in its rotation is perfectly playable until it
// reaches that map; refusing the join would invent a problem the engine does not
// have. What is refused is joining a server whose current map is absent, because
// that connection fails immediately.

 * every map already on disk included, under headings that were mostly empty. A ready server —
 * the ordinary case, and the one a player is trying to pick out of the list — drew two headings,
 * a state name and a paragraph of maps it already has, and pushed the address and the freshness

 * nothing; silence is the correct rendering of "nothing to do"*, and an explanation earns a
 * paragraph only if it changes the next click.
 *
 * So this returns `null` outright for a compatible server with nothing to qualify. What survives
 * is what changes the click: the state and how it was reached, what it costs, and the one choice
 * Reveille refuses to make on the player's behalf.
 *
 * The rotation is not drawn at all. A map already on disk needs no row; a missing map that
 * resolves is a number in the button, not a list to read; and *which* maps have no download
 * changes nothing the player can do about them, so the state name counts them and stops there.
