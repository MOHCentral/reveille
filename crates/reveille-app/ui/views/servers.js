// The server list: toolbar, table, status bar.
//
// The table is a real <table> carrying `role="grid"`, so a screen reader gets a
// list of servers rather than a pile of controls, and a keyboard gets **one** tab
// stop for the whole thing. Every row used to be its own tab stop, which put the
// Join button roughly 260 Tab presses from the search box and made the arrow keys
// redundant; worse, focusing a row selected it, so arrowing down twenty rows fired
// twenty catalogue lookups at a third-party service (docs/design-review.md F4).
// A composite widget is one tab stop: the selected row holds `tabindex="0"` and
// every other row and in-row control holds `tabindex="-1"`.
//
// The list states no compatibility *verdict* — no badge, no green, no amber. See
// docs/ui.md §2.1: a status traffic light trains people to click only green, which
// would push roughly a quarter of the live population behind a colour that reads as
// a warning when it actually means "one click of downloads". What it does carry, in
// **Needs**, is the *price*: a countable quantity, colourless except for the one
// state a download cannot fix. The four canonical state names stay in the detail
// pane, where the decision is made and there is room to explain them.
